# P3-Team-StarBurst
A python script that finds and displays correlations between multiple datasets using Pandas

# Project Description

This project analyzes diverse data sets, generates graphs, and determines correlations between the data. The project will perform analysis on datasets with a minimal point of commonality and calculate correlations between them. Once a correlation is analyzed, visual statistical models will produce graphs to visually represent relationships between the trends present in each data source and how they  relate to one another.
