# P3-Team-StarBurst
A python script that finds and displays correlations between multiple datasets using Pandas

# Project Description

This project analyzes diverse data sets, generates graphs, and infers correlations (Not causations) between the data. The overarching focus of the comparisons is sleep and how that can relate to many disperate datasets. Sleep is arguably one of the most important factors to human health. A lack of sleep is medically proven to be equivelant to being drunk despite the common belief that sleep doesn't matter that much to health. Letting the data lead us to conclusions is the purpose of this project.
